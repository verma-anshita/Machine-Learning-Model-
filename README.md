# Prudential_Life_Insurance_Dataset_Project-Machine Learning

# Introduction
Implemented various Machine Learning Techniques on Prudential Life Insurance Dataset available on Kaggle site.

# Objective
To identify important features (attributes/columns in this dataset), useful for undestanding the major factors affecting Insurance Application's Acceptance or Rejection of an applicant.
* Study the real data to understand Machine Learning Use Case.
* Find out the accuracy and machine learning models best suited for financial type datasets.

# Implementation
* Performed data cleaning, data preprocessing and data preparation using python libraries : 
    * Matplotlib and 
    * Seaborn Library.
* Encoded data, removed outliners and performed dimentionality reduction by using:
    * Correlation Coefficient
    * Mutual Information
* Tried following Models on dataset:
    * Logistic Regression
    * Random Forest
    * Support Vector Machine
    * XGBoost

# Findings
* BMI came out to be one of the most important feature for determining risk.
* Random Forest Classifier gave highest accuracy.
